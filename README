The Buster Optimizer is a command line tool to find the optimal Mega Man Legends
Buster Gun setup given your available parts and the stats you wish to prioritize.

To compile, simply run 'cargo build --release' assuming you have cargo installed.
Copy 'BusterParts.csv' to the directory with the executable, then modify it to
mark which parts you have available. Adding '//' or '#' to the start of a line
tells the program to ignore that line.

By default, all buster parts for Mega Man Legends 1 are available and all buster
parts for Mega Man Legends 2 are deactivated.

When running the program, pass in the name of the file with all the buster
parts, as well as parameters to tell the program how to prioritize the buster
stats, which game you are playing, and whether or not you have the adapter plug.
All options to control the program are specified by running it with the '-h' or
'--help' command.
